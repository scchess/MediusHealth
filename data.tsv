treating orthostatic hypotension	my mother entered the hospital 39 days ago due to bleeding from her intestinal tract after tests they determined it was a case of diverticulitis while she was there she became orthostatic hypotensive where the blood pressure dropped significantly that she passes out she has had dizzy spells in the past but not to this degree about 3 years ago she was diagnosed by a neuro surgeon that she had stenosis and it was recommend that she remove the bulging disk from her neck but she decided not to getting back to oh doctors have tired most all the standard techniques and medication combination to treat this but with no success she finally had surgery last week on the neck with hopes that the nerves being compressed may alleviate the blood pressure control but so far that did not help cardiologist suggest we try a pacemaker to help control the beats per minute of her heart to increase flow another cardiologist suggested this won't work and preferred we try mestinon and midodrine they installed the pacemaker and the next day they tried to get her up and the blood pressure still dropped the doctor instructed the nurse to administer the mestinon and midodrine in the morning before trying to get her up heart maybe pump more blood but it's still going down to the lower extremities anyone have any inputs of where to go from here is this it and she is bed ridden for the rest of her life which they suggest may be limited due to the fact she is bed ridden or wheel chair ridden
ways to stop syncope epidsode	does anyone know of ways to stop the loss of consciousness and prevent a syncope episode i know about staying hydrated applied tension and avoiding triggers i'm asking if there is anything more certain or absolute other than lying down like an epipen for fainting i would think that you would need something to compensate the sudden drop in blood pressure the first thing that comes to my mind is some kind a lower body compression something like a fighter pilot g suit the other thing i thought of was the ammonia tablets that are inhaled to "wake" people back up i don't know much about these though or if they really do anything to stop syncope i don't know how that would do anything for blood pressure thanks for the help
syncope : bodily movement and open eyes	i have suffered from fainting spells most of my life that have all been triggered by pain not all types of pain but specific mostly sharper pain recently i accidentally cut the tip of my index finger and it started bleeding profusely and my first instinct was to lie down to prevent falling and injuring myself in case i did faint immediately i lied on the floor for about a minute and felt better and then got back up which was a mistake because my body did not fully recover i sat on a couch and my head and ears got very hot and then feeling overwhelmed i closed my eyes i could not shake it off what seemed like hours but was really about 2 minutes i woke up again very slowly trying to piece back together where i was first my hearing comes back and i ask myself 'where am i' once i hear familiar things i cry because of the confused feeling of being 'gone' or having 'left' without knowing my brain completely reboots during the episode i felt like i was searching for something and i try to make sense of things while in the 'dream' i find myself in unspecific 'alternate realities' where i find some security even though i'm still searching my husband has witnessed me fainting twice and both times i have moved waving my arms and legs around with my eyes open and empty expression even though my eyes are closed when i faint my husband says they snap back open with a 'zombie-like' expression that scares him in my dreams i cannot see even though my eyes are open i cannot see anything specific though i feel like i've been to a thousand different places i wonder if it could have been a seizure he tells me that i don't move very jerky or fast and i have not had any muscle pain from over exertion like if i had a seizure and my eyes do not roll back into my head i wonder why this happens i am not afraid of the sight of blood that does not make me faint from my experience i have drunken cold water and sometimes it prevents it altogether it's almost like i faint so severely that my brain goes dead for a second i have had an mri or cat scan (i cant remember which) when i was younger that came back normal maybe my body has a low pain threshold things like needles knee scrapes and stubbing my toe have not made me faint either also the pain that i actually feel is not that immense when i cut my finger i was not screaming or in a lot of actual pain my body overreacts next time i'll stay lying down for at least 15 minutes to attempt to prevent it what really concerns me is the movement and open eyes why does this happen

hypotension steady heart rate chest pain	here's one for you it's not me it's my girlfriend for some time she has complained of intermittent chest pain they discovered a blockage in the left ventrical ok i'll buy that now then she was perscribed nitro to aleiviate the pain it does nothing to help she's on two different medications for hypotension but she's almost always still low even after taking them she also tends to get shakey and sometimes passes out at any given moment regardless of activity she was just in the hospital for several days where they did pretty much nothing but monitor her blood pressure and let her go when the top number finally reached 92 (still seems low to me) no one seems motivated to really fix the problem just give a couple meds that only sort of mask things and act as a bandaid for the problem thoughts
